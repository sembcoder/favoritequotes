<h1>Shannon Muir's Favorite Quotations</h1>

<h4>The Brevity of Life</h4>
<p>"To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
To the last syllable of recorded time,
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
And then is heard no more: it is a tale
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
Signifying nothing."<br><em>-Shakespeare</em></p>

<h4>Parts to Play</h4>
<p>"All the world's a stage,
And all the men and women merely players."<br><em>-Shakespeare</em></p>

<h4>The Strength of Books</h4>
<p>"Dreams, books, are each a world; and books, we know,
Are a substantial world, both pure and good.
Round these, with tendrils strong as flesh and blood,
Our pastime and our happiness will grow."<br><em>-William Wordsworth</em></p>


<h4>The Power of a Pronoun</h4>
<p>"But no living man am I! You look upon a woman. Eowyn am I, Eomund's daughter. You stand between me and my lord and kin. Begone, if you be not deathless! For living or dark undead, I will smite you, if you touch him."<br><em>-J.R.R. Tolkien</em></p>

<h4>The Paths We Tread</h4>
<p>"Two roads diverged in a yellow wood and I - I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference."<br><em>-Robert Frost</em></p>

<h4>On What Makes Someone Great</h4>
<p>"Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon 'em."<br><em>-Shakespeare</em?</p>
